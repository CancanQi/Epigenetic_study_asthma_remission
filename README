# Epigenetics of asthma remission

** Definitions of asthma remission **

1. clinical remission: 
  1) No use of any asthma medication, 
  2) no symptoms (asthma attacks and wheeze) in the past year or in the past three years (the questionnaire differed on this between the different cohorts included)

2. complete remission: 
  1) No use of any asthma medication, 
  2) no symptoms (asthma attacks and wheeze) in the past year or in the past three years, 
  3) no BHR (either histamine or methacholine bronchoprovocation test), 
  4) FEV1% predicted pre bronchodilator > 80% OR FEV1%predicted post bronchodilator > 90%
  
  
** Data **

1. DNA methylation: both blood and nasal brushes

2. phenotype: age, gender, remission (0 = asthma,1 = clinical remission only ("clinical remission without complete remission"), 2 = complete remission )
  smoking, ICS, batch, lung function measurement (FEV1, FVC, FEV1pred, FVCpred), age onset asthma, BHR (?)
  longitudinal data: baseline and last visit
  
3. RNAseq: only nasal brushes

4. other data: genotype (?)


** Analysis **

1. EWAS of asthma remission (complete remission and all remission) in blood;

2. Replication of all remission (in LifeLines); complete remission (in EGEA); meta-analysis of discovery and replication (?);

3. EWAS of asthma remission (complete remission and all remission) in nasal brushes;

4. Comparison of results in nasal and blood (?)

5. eQTM of nasal data

6. ???
